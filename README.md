Here, we propose a data-driven multi-model ensemble is constructed using a series of statistical and machine learning methods with varying inputs. Deterministic 
precipitation forecasts are produced by the weighting of ensemble members using Bayesian model averaging (BMA) and probabilistic forecasts are generated by sampling from BMA predictive probability density function (PDF).

The ensembles are constructed by merging data-driven (such as the ANN, LSTM, RF, ConvLSTM) and model-driven methods (such as the CMC1-CanCM3, CMC2-CanCM4, GFDL-CM2p1-AER04, GFDL-CM2p5-FLOR-B01, CFSV2 from NMME).
